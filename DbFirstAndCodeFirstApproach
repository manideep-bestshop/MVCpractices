-In the context of ASP.NET MVC Core and Entity Framework, there are a few different approaches to working with databases:

1.Code-First Approach:
 In the code-first approach, you define your domain model classes first, without worrying about the underlying database schema.
You then use Entity Framework to generate the database schema based on your model classes.This approach is often preferred for its flexibility and ease of development.

Classes-----------ado.net EF------------table [ex. dept,emp [Entity Framework] [dept,emp tables] classes]

2.Database-First Approach:
  In the database-first approach, you start with an existing database schema.You then use Entity Framework to generate the 
corresponding model classes based on the database schema.This approach is useful when you already have an existing database schema or when working with databases designed by database administrators.

tables----------------ado.net----------------classes [dept,emp tables] [Dept,Emp classes]

DbFirst Vs CodeFirst:
---------------------

Ease of Initial setup:
---------------------

DbFirst: We can start quickly if we have already existed Database and tables

CodeFirst: need more setup , need to define domain model and Db Context from scratch

When reccommended:
----------------

DbFirst: This approach is useful when you already have an existing database schema

CodeFirst: when developer shuldhandle db tables from front end approach

Control:
-------

DbFirst: Less control on Database schema,craeted externally

CodeFirst: Control over Database schema, we can do easy modifications in database
           we can easily apply data annotations.
